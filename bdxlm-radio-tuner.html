I just want 4-5 speakers playing radio throughout. I also would like to be able to mount this in a rack with the rest of my networking and DVR equipment and was hoping for some reasonably prices suggestions on the tuner and maybe even some speakers. Thanks. Vice versa would I lose Google Maps navgiation from Android Auto if I'm looking at the Radio/Tuner? I'm curious about 
Was repairing a used Grundig Transistor 3005 (AM/FM tuning cord snapped) and didn't have any on hand.noticed my badge clip (springy retractable belt clip kind) had something that was the exact same size, smashed the badge clip.now  Can anybody help me with this. I used to be able to listen to the radio on my galaxy S6 with a built in FM/AM Tuner. It used my earphones as an antenna. Now it's disappeared and I cannot find the app anywhere. I've tried looking in the app stores and even online for a apk file to use but cannot find one that works offline anywhere. What I have found though (and really grinds my gears) is plenty of websites saying that this feature was turned off because it's not profitable. Hello! My great-grandmother left me an old tube radio. While FM (UKW) works just fine and the pointer moves properly, the common pointer of AM+SW(KW, LW, MW) just moves slightly when I turn the knob (maybe 1 millimeter of a 15 cm-sized spectrum). It's stuck on the right side of the band (lower end), and being no expert I'm not sure of what the problem might be. Can someone help me out? Thanks in advance. Reddit user GENERAL_A_L33 on the forum used FM radio capability as an argument for having the headphone jack, which was a great argument. When the power goes out, you can't rely on the Internet to get updates; you only have the radio. Google, of all companies, as far as I am aware, has not enabled their FM radio tuner on their unlocked devices, at least here in the US. Which is odd; you would think that a company like Google would enable the FM radio tuner because it is so useful in emergency. When I bought my 2009 VW Rabbit, I heard it came with an XM/satellite radio tuner. I asked the dealership to remove that, which saved me about 0 on the price of the car. They also apparently put in a more basic AM/FM tuner radio with 6-CD changer. I think cars with a satellite radio tuner also normally have the "shark fin" style antenna? Mine had a regular radio antenna when I picked up the car. I have since put an aftermarket stereo in the car which supports a satellite radio tuner I would appreciate any help with finding this stupid mundane part that's been bugging me for 2 years. Every now and then I would look for the part but I've never been able to find it. This is the part number for the radio- AH6T-19C158-AJ Again any help would be awesome. Last winter I started to experience some issues with high SWR and my IC746pro reducing power because of the high SWR. So this spring I took down the old G5RV-jr and replaced it. While I was shopping I picked up a CN-901 cross needle SWR meter and installed it as well. The radio will tune the G5RV-jr with no problem. Get a solid TUNE light, not the blinking "I can't tune this bed-spring" error. When I transmit I see the radio shows an SWR of 1:1 but the cross needle is showing something 
Hi all! LukeLC, aka Lulech23, creator of Vidsquish (https://steamcommunity.com/groups/vidsquish) here (which also has FFXV support, by the way!). It seems I've been a bit beaten to the punch on this one, but since I started working on a way to replace the Regalia's music a while ago I thought I'd go ahead and share my results. Repurposing bits of Vidsquish, I've created a very simple, user-friendly GUI for playing, exporting, and replacing FFXV's \ .sab files. I call it Radio Tuner So I bought a Xiaomi note 4 which was supposed to have an fm radio tuner. Now the fm radio app is there but it only finds radio on a single frequency with just noise on everything else. I've been trying to get another app which makes use of this fm receiver but almost all of the apps are streaming apps, and the others either don't work at all, or are just ad platforms without any substance. I looked for some on the Internet for some 40 minutes now but I can't find a single, simple radio tuner. FRICK. I just found out the S8 has a radio tuner. What. Sorry if my wording makes me sound like a total noob, i know very little about working Just wondering if there is an external lightning adapter that tunes into radio stations Wife and I take the family to a drive-in theater and instead of using the car radio, or to complement them, we‚Äôd like to be able to tune into the radio transmitter and the Bluetooth it to our portable UE Boom speakers. We don‚Äôt sit in the station wagon, we lift the hatch and sit behind it with our picnic blanket and foods. Hello. I just purchased a Yamaha TX-492RDS and it works alright with some frequencies. However, I can't tune even number frequencies, only odd number ones. This is extremely painful as I bought this tuner specifically for our national classical music station, that broadcasts at 88.0 where I live. Is there any way I can fix this issue?
